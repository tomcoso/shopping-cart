# Conditum shopping app

Technologies :

- React
- Redux
- React Router Dom
- Jest
- Testing-library

Conditum is a mock shopping single page application (SPA) built using React.

I implemented Redux to manage state but also decided to learn react context.

I started the project with Test Driven Development (TDD). But I realised that unit testing with react on a small project like this is more of a nuissance than it is useful. It would be better to just do integration tests.
Nevertheless I learnt a lot about mocking state, context and webAPIs.
